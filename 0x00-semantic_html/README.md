# 📄 Semantic HTML Practice – 0-index.html & 1-index.html  

## 🎯 Objective  
The goal of these tasks was to practice structuring a simple HTML document using semantic elements, and then to enhance the structure with meta tags for improved SEO, accessibility, and responsiveness.

## 📝 How I Approached the Tasks  

### Task 1: Creating `0-index.html`  
- I began by creating a new file named **`0-index.html`**.  
- The first step was adding the **doctype declaration** `<!DOCTYPE html>` to define the document as HTML5.  
- Next, I added the root `<html>` tag, and inside it, I placed the `<head>` (kept empty for now) and the `<body>` tags.  
- Inside the `<body>`:  
  - I built a `<header>` element that contains a `<nav>` with three navigation links.  
  - I then created a `<main>` section to hold the primary content.  
    - Inside `<main>`, I added an `<article>` with:  
      - A `<h1>` for the article’s title.  
      - A `<section>` to hold the article’s content.  
  - At the bottom, I added a `<footer>` with the text: `@copyright`.  
- Finally, I reviewed the structure to make sure it followed **semantic HTML5 best practices** for readability, accessibility, and SEO.

### Task 2: Enhancing `1-index.html`  
- I copied the content of **`0-index.html`** into a new file named **`1-index.html`**.  
- Inside the `<head>` section, I added meta tags to improve SEO, accessibility, and responsiveness:  
  - `<meta charset="utf-8">` to define the character encoding.  
  - `<meta name="description">` to summarize the content of the page.  
  - `<meta name="keywords">` to provide relevant keywords.  
  - `<meta name="author">` to specify the author of the page.  
  - `<meta name="viewport">` to ensure the page scales well on mobile devices.  
- I also added a `<title>` tag with the text **"Semantic Html Blog Post"** so that the document has a descriptive title.  
- These changes improved the document’s **search engine visibility**, **mobile responsiveness**, and **overall accessibility**.
