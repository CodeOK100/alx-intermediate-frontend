## 📝 How I Approached the Task  

- I began by creating a new file named **`0-index.html`**.  
- The first step was adding the **doctype declaration** `<!DOCTYPE html>` to define the document as HTML5.  
- Next, I added the root `<html>` tag, and inside it, I placed the `<head>` (kept empty for now) and the `<body>` tags.  
- Inside the `<body>`:  
  - I built a `<header>` element that contains a `<nav>` with three navigation links.  
  - I then created a `<main>` section to hold the primary content.  
    - Inside `<main>`, I added an `<article>` with:  
      - A `<h1>` for the article’s title.  
      - A `<section>` to hold the article’s content.  
  - At the bottom, I added a `<footer>` with the text: `@copyright`.  
- Finally, I reviewed the structure to make sure it followed **semantic HTML5 best practices** for readability, accessibility, and SEO.
