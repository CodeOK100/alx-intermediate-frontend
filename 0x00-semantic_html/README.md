# üìÑ Semantic HTML Practice ‚Äì 0-index.html, 1-index.html & 2-index.html  

## üéØ Objective  
The goal of these tasks was to progressively practice structuring HTML documents using semantic elements, enhance them with meta tags for SEO and accessibility, and finally apply semantic elements to create a **blog post layout**.

## üìù How I Approached the Tasks  

### Task 1: Creating `0-index.html`  
- I began by creating a new file named **`0-index.html`**.  
- The first step was adding the **doctype declaration** `<!DOCTYPE html>` to define the document as HTML5.  
- Next, I added the root `<html>` tag, and inside it, I placed the `<head>` (kept empty for now) and the `<body>` tags.  
- Inside the `<body>`:  
  - I built a `<header>` element that contains a `<nav>` with three navigation links.  
  - I then created a `<main>` section to hold the primary content.  
    - Inside `<main>`, I added an `<article>` with:  
      - A `<h1>` for the article‚Äôs title.  
      - A `<section>` to hold the article‚Äôs content.  
  - At the bottom, I added a `<footer>` with the text: `@copyright`.  
- Finally, I reviewed the structure to make sure it followed **semantic HTML5 best practices** for readability, accessibility, and SEO.

### Task 2: Enhancing `1-index.html`  
- I copied the content of **`0-index.html`** into a new file named **`1-index.html`**.  
- Inside the `<head>` section, I added meta tags to improve SEO, accessibility, and responsiveness:  
  - `<meta charset="utf-8">` to define the character encoding.  
  - `<meta name="description">` to summarize the content of the page.  
  - `<meta name="keywords">` to provide relevant keywords.  
  - `<meta name="author">` to specify the author of the page.  
  - `<meta name="viewport">` to ensure the page scales well on mobile devices.  
- I also added a `<title>` tag with the text **"Semantic Html Blog Post"** so that the document has a descriptive title.  
- These changes improved the document‚Äôs **search engine visibility**, **mobile responsiveness**, and **overall accessibility**.

### Task 3: Creating a Blog Layout in `2-index.html`  
- I copied the content of **`1-index.html`** into a new file named **`2-index.html`**.  
- Inside the `<header>`:  
  - I added an `<h1>` with the text **"My Blog"**.  
  - I created a `<nav>` containing a `<ul>` with three `<li>` elements linking to **Home**, **About**, and **Contact**.  
- Inside the `<article>` (within `<main>`):  
  - I added a `<header>` containing an `<h2>` titled **"Understanding Semantic HTML"**.  
  - I included a `<p>` with a **published date**, using a `<time>` element for proper semantics.  
  - For the main content, I structured it with **three `<section>` blocks**:  
    1. **Introduction Section**:  
       - `<h3>` with the text **"Introduction"**.  
       - `<p>` explaining how semantic HTML improves accessibility and SEO.  
    2. **Main Content Section**:  
       - `<h3>` with the text **"Main Content"**.  
       - `<p>` describing the importance of `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<header>` tags.  
       - `<figure>` with an `<img>` (with `alt="example"`) and `<figcaption>` describing the illustration.  
    3. **Conclusion Section**:  
       - `<h3>` with the text **"Conclusion"**.  
       - `<p>` emphasizing how semantic HTML improves accessibility, SEO, and navigation.  
  - Finally, I added a `<footer>` inside the `<article>` with:  
    - A `<p>` stating **"Written by <name>"**.  
    - A `<p>` stating **"Published on 2024-09-11"**.  
- This created a complete **blog-style layout** using semantic HTML, ensuring clarity, accessibility, and strong document structure.
