# 📘 Tailwind CSS Practice – Grid, Flexbox & Responsive Layouts  

## 📖 Introduction  
This project is part of my **ALX Pro Frontend journey**.  
It focuses on setting up **Tailwind CSS** and using it to build modern, responsive layouts with **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox**.  

By working through a series of tasks, I learned how to:  
- Set up Tailwind in a project.  
- Use CSS Grid to create multi-column layouts.  
- Use Flexbox to create responsive navigation bars and layouts.  
- Combine Grid and Flexbox effectively.  
- Build a responsive image gallery.
