# ðŸ“˜CSS Preprocessors: SASS/SCSS for Efficient Styling

This project is a practical introduction to **SASS/SCSS**, a CSS preprocessor that adds superpowers to plain CSS.  
This demonstrates how to use **variables, nesting, mixins, and debug outputs** to write more efficient, scalable, and maintainable stylesheets.
